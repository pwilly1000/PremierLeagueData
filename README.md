# PremierLeagueData
This was a project I did to practice my skills with Pandas, sqlite3, and matplotlib. The data I used for this project was found at https://fbref.com/en/. The data, which spanned the last 3 Premier League seaons, was downloaded into csv format which I loaded into Jupyter Notebook and cleaned up a bit. I then converted the data into a database so I could use SQL queries to obtain information.
Here is an an example of one of the graphs I created to answer a question I was curious about.
